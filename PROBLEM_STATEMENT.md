# Problem Statement

## EduManage - Class Management System

---

## Background

Every year, millions of students want to pass exams to get into university. They study English, IELTS, TOEIC, math, and science at training centers after school.

As these centers grow with more students and classes, they face problems: tracking attendance, managing grades, sharing materials, and handling payments. Paper and notebooks are not enough.

**EduManage** solves this. It helps training centers manage classes, attendance, grades, and communication—all in one place.
